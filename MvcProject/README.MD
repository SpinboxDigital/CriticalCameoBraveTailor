InterviewMVC project:

The Index action on the HomeController shows a listing view of MockUser items. The display name for the LastName column is not correct. Please correct to show "Last name" rather than "LastName".

The Details action is not currently showing the details for each particular user. Please implement the Details action on the HomeController to show the users details correctly.

A well-intentioned manager has decided that the background colour for the Details view should be that of the users FavouriteColour property, please implement.

The users in the Index view are not ordered correctly, they should be ordered by LastName, and then by FirstName in ascending order.

Filtering of the users will be implemented in the future, in the mean time, only 20 users should be shown on the Index page

The Email column on the Index page should be a mailto anchor rather than text, please amend.
